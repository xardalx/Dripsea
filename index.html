              and its ocean.
              We are an informative website whose aim is to highlight scientific information on this important topic in
              a way that is available, easy to understand and playful for everyone.
              Our main goal is to awaken mentalities and encourage everyone to act for this cause.
              The ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean is getting weaker every day and we don't want to let it down but to
              fight for it. It is an everyday struggle, and it is a struggle that can be changed if we all work
              together.

        <p class="intro_marine">As widely researched by NASA, temperatures in the Arctic rapidly rise, having an impact
          on the melting of ice. Over the last 100 years, the temperature has risen almost twice as much as the global
          average rate. The earlier disintegration and melting of the Arctic sea ice in the spring and then later
          freezing in the winter leave the sea unfrozen for a long time. This phenomenon currently affects several
          species of arctic animals. Ice cover is changing rapidly, in both extent and thickness, and shrinking far too
          quickly for these species to adapt. We will focus on the most endangered species of animals, such as polar
          bears, foxes, seals, and walruses.

              <h2>Why are polar bears so important?</h2>
              <p>Polar bears help us gain an understanding of what is happening throughout the Arctic. They are large
                carnivores meaning they are at the top of the food chain - and are particularly important indicators of
                the health of an ecosystem.

              <h2>How does climate change affect polar bears?</h2>
              <p>
                <b>Big problem with hunting:</b><br>
                Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt and store energy for the summer and autumn, when food can be scarce.
                Sea
                ice now melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the autumn in the bears’ southern range, like
                Hudson

              <h2>Why are polar foxes so important?</h2>
              <p>Organic waste from the foxes and their kills make the area surrounding their dens more fertile, leading
                to almost three times as many dune panes of grass, willows, and wildflowers to sprout up, compared to
                the rest of the tundra.

              <h2>How does climate change affect polar foxes?</h2>
              <p>Big problem with hunting:
                Because Arctic foxes rely heavily on lemmings for food, climate change impacts on lemmings can have
                profound effects on foxes. During the winter, lemmings live in spaces under the snow that provide
                insulation from the cold, protection from predators, and access to plant foods. Rising temperatures due
                to climate change can cause poor snow conditions for lemming life. These poor snow conditions can cause
                the gradual extinction of polar foxes.

              <h2>Why are walruses so important?</h2>
              <p>Walruses can have a large effect on their prey and play an important role in the Arctic ecosystem by
                influencing the structure of benthic invertebrate communities. They can eat more than 50 clams during a
                single 7-minute dive to the seafloor and consume 35–50 kilograms.
              </p>

              <h2>How does climate change affect walruses?</h2>
              <p>Walruses depend on sea ice as platforms for feeding and to rest, and the warming Arctic disrupts their
                daily lives. In the past decade, the earlier melting of sea ice in the summer has caused the flushes to
                float to the shores of the ocean. This phenomenon can be fatal for them, especially for cubs who die
                when washed out.

              <h2>Why are seals so important?</h2>
              <p>Seals are top predators. They eat fish, squid, and crustaceans, including some of the species that
                fishermen catch. Seals also have the unique ability to contribute nutrients to the edge of the ocean

              <br>
              <h2>How does climate change affect seals?</h2>
              <p> According to the Union of
                Concerned Scientists, almost no seal pups, dependent on sea ice, survived during the ice-free years of
                1967, 1981, 2000, 2001, and 2002. Environmental scientists, Dr. Clive McMahon and Dr. Harry Burton of
                the Australian Antarctic Division have concluded that the warming climate is changing the ocean’s
                ecology to such a degree that the survival of seals and their young has increasingly become a concern
                for marine biologists.

                <p> SSome fish species that can be found on the Arctic Ocean are on the list of the endangered species
                  created by the
                  IUCN; for example, the Chum salmon and the Atlantic salmon (that can be found on the Arctic Ocean
                  despite its
                  name) are considered as threatened by the environmental changes. They have been threatened by the
                  changes in
                  temperature of the water and the alterations in sea currents.
                  More than being threatened, some of them are already considered as extinct in the wildlife by the IUCN
                  like the
                  Beloribitsa: it is considered extinct in the wild because it’s a fish that has a long way to migrate
                  for its
                  reproduction (more than 3,000km) and because of human construction and the changes on the sea, it is
                  impossible
                  for them to actually do it again.
                  To explain how hard climate change is on the Arctic Ocean, there is the Dolly Varden Trout case. This
                  fish can
                  be found in a lot of different seas in the world but is listed as a species of special concern in the

        <p class="intro_temperatures">As widely researched by NASA, temperatures in the Arctic rapidly rise, having an
          impact
          on the melting of ice. Over the last 100 years, the temperature has risen almost twice as much as the global
          average rate. The earlier disintegration and melting of the Arctic sea ice in the spring and then later
          freezing in the winter leave the sea unfrozen for a long time. This phenomenon currently affects several
          species of arctic animals. Ice cover is changing rapidly, in both extent and thickness, and shrinking far too
          quickly for these species to adapt. We will focus on the most endangered species of animals, such as polar
          bears, foxes, seals, and walruses.

            <h2>Sea currents are changing</h2>
            <p>The Beaufort Gyre is a powerful oceanic current that carries cold freshwater swirling around underneath
              the arctic icecap. Powered by polar winds, the current protects the ice sheet from warm water residing
              underneath. As the arctic ice sheet thins with a warming planet, the polar winds become more effective,
              making the current stronger. The Gyre thus picks-up more freshwater, which eventually gets released all at
              once when the direction of the current changes, every 5 to 7 years. The sudden release of this water all
              at once has the potential to induce catastrophic effects on western Europe. To read more, please follow

            <h2>Polar Amplification & The Arctic</h2>
            <p>Polar amplification refers to the melting of the polar ice sheets exacerbating the effects of global
              warming. Ice reflects about 50 to 70 percent of solar rays back into space, as opposed to the ocean’s
              meager 6 to 7 percent. With roughly 14 million square kilometers surface level ice, the arctic is one of
              the most crucial elements in maintaining a stable climate on Earth. As it melts, the effects of solar rays
              become much more severe, leading to a dangerous cycle of climate change that will affect generations to
              come. To read more about the process, check out this Scientific American article: <a

            <h2>Ocean acidification</h2>
            <p>Ocean Acidification refers to the increasing levels of pH in the world’s oceans, as a result of CO2
              pollution. The delicate balance of the world’s ecosystems is heavily disrupted by this, causing mass
              deaths within the food chain. This has a ripple effect that eventually reaches us, as seen in, for
