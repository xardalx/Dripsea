Hi Kristian. How's life in Tarp these days? You know, by the time you're reading this, I've already moved, but it's nice to know that at least for a little 
bit, I shared that place with someone else from the school. I'm gonna miss Ali Baba Pizza though, even if the owner was a little rude to me that one time.
